# Todo
- clear screen for linux not necessary
- password hashing for users
- filtering process
- Adding classes to make the code more object oriented
- we can save users to csv
- password shouldn't be seen when logging in or on registration

## Filters
you can filter on these fields: brand,display,cpu,ram,storage,price

## Project setup

Important note: Make sure you already have chrome installed on your pc

clone this repository, open it in vs code and run the following command in your terminal (assuming the active directory is the root folder of the project where `requirements.txt` file is located):
```ps
C:\example\path\to\LapShop> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```



after requirements are installed, run the main file to get it going:
```ps
C:\example\path\to\LapShop> python .\main.py
```

when you first run the app, it will scrape data from zoomit.ir
